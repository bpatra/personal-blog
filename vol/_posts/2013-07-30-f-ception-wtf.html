The subject presented here came from a kind of "wtf contest" that we had with a colleague of mine on our free time. The objective was to write&nbsp;a unit test to tackle an existing code base using the weirdest approach. My contestant Gabriel is a brilliant developer, so in order to compete with him I had to bring something really absurd rather than technically sophisticated. So I came with the idea of executing F# code inlined in a powershell script invoked from F# code. Obviously, this is absolutely useless. However, it fitted well for the thematic of the &nbsp;contest. In this post we&nbsp;will skip the "existing code base" part&nbsp;and focus on how to achieve this with a very simple example .</p>
<p>The first part of the job is to write some F# code that builds the powershell script with inlined F#. We will have to reference the F# code dom provider which can be downloaded&nbsp;<a title="here" href="http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/">here</a>. Remark that for the sake of simplicity of this post we did not add any extra assemblies (see&nbsp;<em>referencedAssemblies</em> in script below).</p>

<p>Then let us try the&nbsp;<em>FsToPs</em> function with very simple case</p>

<p>Thus, the powershell code in <em>simpleExample.ps1</em> looks like</p>
<p>https://gist.github.com/bpatra/6098589</p>
<p>You should be able to run this script in a powershell session. However, it is not finished for us, we have to invoke this script in F# and retrieve the returned value. The following snippet will do the job for us.</p>

<p>Then executed within MsTest framework....</p>

<p>...it works!</p>

<p>I'd like to thank Gabriel for being fair play by helping me to debug the first version of F#-ception.</p>
