Hi, I am Beno√Æt Patra, welcome to my personal blog. My current occupation is Chief Technology Officer at [iAdvize](https://www.iadvize.com).

{% include image-caption.html imageurl='/assets/images/pages/about2.jpg' title="Benoit Patra" position_class="image-right"%}

My initial background is in mathematics, I graduated from ENS Cachan and I hold a PhD in mathematics (probability/statistics/machine learning). If you want to take a look at my past academic work, check [this page](/academic). 

I have been working in the software industry for more than ten years now. For more details, I invite you to consult my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoit-patra/). You can also listen [to this podcast in french](https://podcast.ausha.co/cto-z-1/cto-z-28-benoit-patra-atiadvize-done-is-better-than-perfect) where I share feedbacks on my professional experiences.

I am a tech and science enthusiast. Regarding programming, I have deep interest and curiosity about all its aspects: from frontend to backend passing by DevOps. Of course I still have a strong taste for machine learning and datascience topics. Software development is definitely also about people and creating successful teamwork also matters to me a lot. 

Why this blog? I see this blog as a good opportunity to share some technical stuff. Yet I maintain this blog mainly because it is a good exercise for me. Indeed, this is a very efficient way for a native french speaker living in France to write english content on a regular basis.

On the personal side, I am married and a father of two. I am also very fond of sailing and all watersports. I practice regularly racing, cruising, windsurfing, kitesurfing, foiling, dinghies etc.
