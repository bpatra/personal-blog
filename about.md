Hi, I am Beno√Æt Patra, welcome to my personal blog. My current occupation is Chief Technology Officer at <a title="iAdvize" href="https://www.iadvize.com/">iAdvize</a>.

My initial background is in mathematics, I graduated from ENS Cachan and I hold a PhD in mathematics that combines the following fields: probability and machine learning. If you want to take a look at my past academic work, check [this page](/academic). 

I have been working in the software industry for more than ten years now. For more details, I invite you to consult my <a title="LinkedIn profile" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoit-patra/">LinkedIn profile</a>. 

When it comes to programming, I enjoy all aspects of it: from frontend to backend passing by DevOps topics. Of course I still have a strong taste for machine learning and datascience. Software development is also a matter of people and creating successful teamwork also matters to me a lot. 

Why this blog? I see this blog as a good opportunity to share some technical stuff. But I maintain this blog mainly because it is a good exercise for me. Indeed, this is a very efficient way for a native french speaker living in France to write english content on a regular basis.

On the personal side, I am married and a father of two. I am also very fond of sailing and all watersports. I practice regularly racing, cruising, windsurfing, kitesurfing, foiling, dinghies etc.
