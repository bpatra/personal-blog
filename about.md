Hi, I am Beno√Æt Patra, welcome to my personal blog. My current occupation is Chief Technology Officer at <a title="iAdvize" href="https://www.iadvize.com/">iAdvize</a>.
My initial background is in mathematics, I am graduated from ENS Cachan and I hold a PhD in mathematics that combines the following fields: probability and machine learning. I have been working in the software industry for more than ten years now. For more details, I invite you to consult my <a title="LinkedIn profile" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoit-patra/">LinkedIn profile</a>. 

If you want to take a look at my past academic work, you can also visit my <a title="personal page" href="http://www.lsta.upmc.fr/doct/patra/">personal page</a> at LSTA-Paris VI University. I also used to be a teacher and I taught mostly mathematics and programming for undergraduates. You'll find in the aforementioned page some exercices and practical courses that you can feel free to use.

Why this blog? I see this blog as a good opportunity to share some technical stuffs. More importantly, I maintain this blog because it is a good exercise for me. Indeed, this is a very efficient way for a native french speaker living in France to write english content on a regular basis.

On the personal side, I am married and a father of two. I am also very fond of sailing and all watersports. I practice regularly racing, cruising, windsurfing, kitesurfing, foiling, dinghies etc.
