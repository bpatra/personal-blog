Hi, my name is Beno√Æt Patra and I currently serve as Chief Technology Officer at [iAdvize](https://www.iadvize.com). Welcome to my personal blog.

My background is in math: I graduated from ENS Cachan with a PhD in mathematics (probability/statistics/machine learning). If you'd like to take a look at my past academic work, see [this page](/academic).

I've been working in the software industry for over a decade. A detailed look at my career can be found on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benoit-patra/). You can also listen [to this podcast in french](https://podcast.ausha.co/cto-z-1/cto-z-28-benoit-patra-atiadvize-done-is-better-than-perfect), where I discuss my professional experiences in depth.

I'm a lifelong tech and science enthusiast with a keen interest in all things programming: from frontend and backend to DevOps. Of course, I still carry a strong curiousity for machine learning and data science topics. I also recognize that software development is very people-driven, and strive to create successful teamwork dynamics in my work.

Why start this blog? I see it as an opportunity to share and discuss technical stuff that's inspiring me. But I also view it as a valuable exercise: blogging is a very efficient way for a native French speaker living in France to write in English on a regular basis.

On the personal side, I'm a father of two twin girls. I'm also very fond of sailing and all watersports. I regularly enjoy racing, cruising, windsurfing, kitesurfing, foiling, and more.
