<p style="text-align: left;">Hi, I am Beno&icirc;t Patra, welcome to my personal blog. I am now CTO at <a title="iAdvize" href="https://www.iadvize.com/">iAdvize</a>. </p>
<p>My initial background is in mathematics, I hold a PhD in mathematics that combines the following fields: probability, machine learning and statistics. I have been working in the software industry for ten years now. For more details, I invite you to consult my <a title="LinkedIn profile" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/benoit-patra/10/a89/648">LinkedIn profile</a>. If you want to have a look on my past academic research you can also visit my <a title="personal page" href="http://www.lsta.upmc.fr/doct/patra/">personal page</a> at LSTA-Paris VI University.</p>
<p>Why this blog? I see this blog as a good opportunity to share some technical stuffs. More importantly I maintain this blog because it is a very efficient way for a native french speaker living in France to write english content on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Apart from the interest fields that I have just mentioned before I am very fond of sailing and watersports (racing, cruising, windsurfing, kitesurf, foils, dinghies...).</p>
